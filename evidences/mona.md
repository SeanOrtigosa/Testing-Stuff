# Mona

## **Can Mona’s 2nd Constellation allow you to trigger Vaporize on a pyro inflicted target twice?**

By: Kimmu\#0007  
Added on 5/12/2020

**Finding:**

Although C2 Lunar Chain reads that the Charged Attack will automatically follow the Normal Attack, the Charged Attack is too slow in proccing damage and so by the time the damage registers, the Hydro Normal Attack  already removes \(and vaporizes\) the pyro status on the enemy.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

C2 is not as good as it could be, because the automatic Charged ATK cannot benefit from Vaporize unless pyro is inflicted in the short period in between the Normal Attack and automatic Charged Attack animation.

## **Is Mona’s Elemental Burst DMG determined at the time of Initial cast or at the time of ‘Bubble Burst’?**

**Finding:**

Mona’s Bubble burst damage is determined at the time the bubble is actually triggered, rather than ‘snapshotting’ on immediate cast.

**Significance:**

This will affect how you maximize Mona ult damage and means that you should remain on Mona after casting her Elemental Burst until the last moment where you switch to the pyro character to burst the bubble.

For example, in the perfect combo, the ATK buff provided by Bennett’s Elemental Burst \(Q\) lasts for ~1-2 seconds after Mona is removed from the field \(switched out\)

During this time, you can burst the bubble knowing that it will do more damage based on the extra ATK from Bennett's ult.  
However, if you switch out for too long, Mona will lose the ATK buff and the bubble burst will not benefit from the ATK buff.

## **How many elemental \(hydro\) particles does Mona’s Elemental Skill \(E\) generate?**

**Finding:**

Mona's E gens 3 or 4 Hydro particles on explosion, seemingly weighted towards 3 particles per cast.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

The fact that Mona's particle gen is seemingly random means there's an RNG aspect to getting her ult up consistently too. May warrant further testing on other characters to see if other fluctuations in particle gen exists. May need to test whether the particle generation is truly random or if there is a pattern.

## **What Attack string combo outputs the highest DPS for Mona?**

By: Baezal\#0868

**Finding:**

2AA + 1 Charged ATK with Jump Cancelling \(JC\) provides the greatest DPS for Mona’s attack string.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

Even without jump cancelling, 2AA + Charged provides similar DPS to Charged JC. Cementing that when Mona is attacking, it is ideal to try to maintain 2 AA + 1 Charged, even if you are not JCing. Note that if you run out of stamina, even 3AA + Charged is still better than 4AA JC.

## **Does Mona’s 15% C1 boost to Vaporize damage apply to Mona’s Q Burst itself?** 

By: Curiously\#2324  
Added on 02/02/2021

**Finding:**

Mona’s 1st Constellation does not boost her Q Burst damage.

**Evidence:**

[**https://youtu.be/x4m2IHwb0uc**](https://youtu.be/x4m2IHwb0uc)

**Significance:**

This has been confirmed due to math being done to break down how Mona's Q Burst damage works and it's been seen that C1 makes the formula wrong. However, just to triple check, there is now clear evidence that the damage difference between C0 and C1 does not change.

## **Is the Omen Damage Buff included in Mona’s Elemental Q Burst damage?**  

By: Gibbigobo\#9750  
Added on 23/02/2021

**Finding:**

Yes, despite the talent description stating that Omen applies after the bubble pops, it in fact applies as soon as Mona’s Elemental Q Burst is cast. See also [Boesik\#3192’s calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ba0FcmShowVomGzLdcyMRLZcRLjeju_L1cjueCZ7644/edit) which you can also use to verify these results.

**Evidence:**

You can see when calculations INCLUDE the Omen Damage buff DMG% values, you get the correct damage calculation to 3 significant figures.

In the first screenshot below. If I were to remove Omen from the calculations, the numbers become obscure and incorrect.

In the second screenshot below, If I were add back the Omen damage bonus to the calculations, we now see accurate numbers that matches up with the actual ingame testing results.
