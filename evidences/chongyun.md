## **3 Attack Rotation Time and Frames + Max Amounts of Shattered Procs with Chongyun Alone \(E is not shattered\)** 

By: shdwbld\#8103

**Findings:**

3 Attack Rotations  
3 Full Damage Rotation takes 11.2 Seconds in Cryo-Field with 8% Attack Speed \(buffed\). The duration of Cryo-Field is 10 seconds but charged attack is still infused due to a lingering effect.  
****

**Rough frames and Seconds**

* Frames: 194 \(1 rotation\)
* Seconds: 3.07 \(1 rotation\)

**3 Attack Rotation's Shattered procs with E freezing enemy.**

* \(E Cast\)Apply Cryo \(freeze\)
* 1st. Shattered + Apply cryo \(freeze\)
* 2nd. Shattered + ICD
* 3rd. ICD
* 4th. Apply cryo \(freeze\)

**--**

**5th. Shattered + ICD**

**6nd. ICD**

**7th. Apply cryo \(freeze\)**

**8th. Shattered + ICD**

**--**

**9th. ICD**

**10th. Apply cryo \(freeze\)**

**11th. Shattered + ICD**

**12th. ICD**  


**Calculations Shattered Procs Conclusion:**

**12 basic attacks**

**5 shattered - \( E shattered\) Since initial slam to the ground of E has it's own ICD, you can have 2 shattered reactions 1st rotation. this will just make it so that you get 1 more reaction and by the end of the 3 rotations, end with a shattered reaction instead of an ICD.**  


**3 Full Damage Rotation take  ~ 11.2 Seconds in Cryo-Field  
  
Chongyun C6 DMG bonus**

**Findings:**

**C6 Chongyun’s “Spirit Blade - Cloud-parting Star deals 15% more DMG to enemies with a lower percentage of their Max HP” is an additive bonus.**  


**Evidence:** 

**Video with the enemy not having a lower percentage of his Max HP than Chongyun:** [**https://streamable.com/u9n1r4**](https://streamable.com/u9n1r4) ****

**Video with the enemy having a lower percentage of his Max HP than Chongyun:** [**https://streamable.com/7hec30**](https://streamable.com/7hec30)

**\(1+0.15+0.223\)/\(1+0.223\) = 320/285 math by Robin** 

**Testing was done with a Lv. 70 Chongyun & 22.3% cryo damage goblet.**  


**Significance: +15% to Cryo Damage+Noblesse - the bonus gained from constellation 6 is about ~7% \(ballpark estimate by Kleeful\) for a well built Chongyun. DMG bonus being additive implies that it would deal less damage than previously expected, where it was assumed to be a multiplicative bonus.**
