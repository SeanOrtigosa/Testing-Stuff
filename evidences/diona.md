## **Diona Elemental Skill ICD analysis**

**Finding:**

The first 2 \(tap\) and last 3 \(hold\) projectiles of Diona's Elemental skill have separate element application cooldowns.

**Evidence:**

After applying a strong fire aura \(Bennet E\), I applied a Cryo trigger from Diona's E.

I also tested waiting between Bennet's E and Diona's E to downgrade the fire element strength.

Bennet E + \(no wait\) + Diona E \(tap\) = 1 melt reaction + weak pyro aura remaining on enemy.

Bennet E + \(no wait\) + Diona E \(hold\) = 2 melt reactions + no element remaining on the enemy.

Bennet E + \(wait 5+ seconds\) + Diona E \(tap\) = 1 melt reaction + no element remaining on the enemy.

Bennet E + \(wait 5+ seconds\) + Diona E \(hold\) = 1 melt reaction + cryo aura remaining on the enemy.

## **Non-charged Aimed Shots share elemental application ICD with Charged Aimed Shots, despite not having an element themselves**

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

For Diona, who's charged shot ICD is higher than the time it takes to fire a second charged shot, this prevents elemental reactions or aura application from occuring on a fully charged shot if you fire a normal aimed shot by accident before it, if the ICD was not active yet.

**Editorâ€™s Note:** The editor tested this with their own Diona unit, as well as Childe and Fischl. The editor can recreate it 100% with Diona, while Childe and Fischl are NOT affected by this issue. **The editor agrees with the author that it is possibly a bug and should be submitted to Mihoyo for investigation.**
