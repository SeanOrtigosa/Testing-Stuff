{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Nightrider" %}
**Press**  
Fischl summons **Oz** a short distance in front of herself and deals Electro DMG in a small AoE at the summon location.

* When **Oz** is already on the field, this ability repositions him next to Fischl instead, without modifying his remaining duration.

| Effect | Talent% / Data |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cast DMG | 161.62% |
| Summon Cooldown | 25s |
| Reposition Cooldown | 1s |

{% tab title="Oz" %}
| Oz Details | Talent% / Data |
| :--- | :--- |
| Normal Attack | 124.32% |
| Attack Speed | 1/s |
| GU | 1A |
| Particles | 0~1 \(2:3\) |
| Damage Type | Elemental Skill |

* **Oz** has a duration of 10s.
* **Oz** normal attacks a total of 10 times over the duration.
* **Oz** has an elemental application ICD of 3-4s, so every 4th hit will apply Electro. Additionally hits 1-6 are considered a separate elemental source from hits 7-10. Thus, against a single target, hits 1, 5, 7 apply electro to the target.
* Additionally, when **Oz’s** normal attack triggers an Overload or Superconduct reaction, it generates 1 particle per enemy hit by the reaction.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Midnight Phantasmagoria" %}
Fischl transforms into **Oz** and gains movement speed. Deals Electro damage to enemies Fischl comes into contact with, once per enemy.

* Fischl may not attack, cast, or dash during the duration of this ability.

* **Oz** normal attacks for a total of 12 times over the duration.
* **Oz** has an elemental application ICD of 3-4s, so every 4th hit will apply electro. Additionally hits 1-6 are considered a separate elemental source from hits 7-12. Thus, against a single target, hits 1, 5, 7, 11 apply electro to the target.
* Additionally, when **Oz’s** normal attack triggers an Overload or Superconduct reaction, it generates 1 particle per enemy hit by the reaction
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Turbo

When Oz triggers Overload or Superconduct with his Normal Attack, he generates a particle for each enemy hit by the reaction. This is called "turbo" energy generation. By this using this mechanic in clumps of enemies, you can gain far more particles per Oz summon than you would normally be able to. Turbo team compositions are built to force this interaction often to fuel expensive elemental bursts to increase overall team damage \(reducing party energy recharge requirements for more damage investment\).

| Number of Enemies | C0-C5 Particles | C6 Particles |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 40.8 | 50 |
| 2 | 52.8 | 65 |
| 3 | 64.8 | 80 |
| 4 | 76.8 | 95 |
| 5 | 88.8 | 110 |
| 6 | 100.8 | 125 |
| 7 | 112.8 | 140 |

_Assumptions: maximum uptime utilizing burst, Oz is the trigger for all 10/12 attacks, and the reactions that occur hit all enemies for 12/15 reactions per minute._
